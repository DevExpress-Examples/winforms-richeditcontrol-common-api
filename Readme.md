# WinForms Rich Text Editor - Manage the Control Behavior in Code

This example demonstrates how to use RichEditControl's API to programmatically manageÂ theÂ RichEditControl's behavior (commands, services).

The application includes the RichEditControl (at the bottom) used to display and edit the code and another RichEditControl (at the top) which shows the result of code execution.

Some of theÂ RichEditControl's methods are executed by clicking the "Custom Action" button located in the RichEditControl's Ribbon menu.
