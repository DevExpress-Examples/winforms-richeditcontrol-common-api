# WinForms - The RichEditControl's common API


<p>This example demonstrates how to use RichEditControl's API to programmatically manage the RichEditControl's behavior (commands, services).<br />The application includes the RichEditControl (at the bottom) used to display and edit the code and another RichEditControl (at the top) which shows the result of code execution.<br />Some of the RichEditControl's methods are executed by clicking the "Custom Action" button located in the RichEditControl's Ribbon menu.<br /><br />See also:</p>
